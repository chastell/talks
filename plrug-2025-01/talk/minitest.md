### `README`

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/test` is a small and incredibly fast<br />unit testing framework. It provides a rich set<br />of assertions to make your tests clean and readable.

</div>

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/spec` is a functionally complete spec engine.<br />It hooks onto `minitest/test` and seamlessly bridges<br />test assertions over to spec expectations.

</div>

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/benchmark` is an awesome way to assert the performance of your algorithms in a repeatable manner.<br />Now you can assert that your newb co-worker doesnâ€™t<br />replace your linear algorithm with an exponential one!

### `README`

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/mock` by Steven Baker,<br />is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)<br />object framework.

</div>

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/pride` shows pride in testing<br />and adds coloring to your test output. I guess<br />it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. `:P`

</div>

<div class="fragment quote">

  `minitest/test` is meant to have a clean implementation<br />for language implementors that need a minimal set of<br />methods to bootstrap a working test suite. For example,<br />there is no magic involved for test-case discovery.
