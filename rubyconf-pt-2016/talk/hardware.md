<p class='quote'>If you’re referring to Apple’s desktop keyboards,<br />the solution is much the same as with Apple mice:<br />you unplug the Apple-provided piece of shit,<br />throw it away, and plug in something that doesn’t suck.<br /><br /><span class='fragment'>Actually, the keyboard, being small, thin and light,<br />is handy for dropping onto the crash cart in a datacentre.<br />Partly because it’s easy to hold it in one’s teeth<br />while half way up a ladder and swearing at a Linux box,<br />and partly because it’s a piece of shit<br />and therefore won’t go walkabouts.</span><br /><br />— Peter Corlett, [hates-software](http://hates-software.com)</p>
