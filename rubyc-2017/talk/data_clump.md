# data clump

* the same set of variables passed in many contexts
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* refactoring: create a composite (value?) object
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* caveat: make sure the clumped variables are related
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* caveat: â€¦and you can decompose them if/when needed
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
